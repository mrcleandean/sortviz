# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer built using React. It allows users to visually understand the workings of different sorting algorithms through animated steps. This educational tool is designed to help both students and enthusiasts gain deeper insights into how sorting algorithms organize and manage data.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: A user-friendly interface that allows users to select different sorting algorithms to visualize.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Supports various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Each sort operation is visualized step-by-step to illustrate the algorithm's process.
- **Speed Control**: Users can adjust the speed of the visualization to better understand each step.

## Running the Project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithm-visualizer.git
cd sortviz
npm install
npm run dev
